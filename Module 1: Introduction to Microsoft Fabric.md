# Microsoft Fabric - Module 1: Introduction to Microsoft Fabric

## Detailed Notes

### **Overview of Microsoft Fabric**
- Microsoft Fabric is an enterprise-ready, end-to-end analytics platform.
- It unifies data movement, data processing, ingestion, transformation, real-time event routing, and report building.
- It supports these capabilities with integrated services like Data Engineering, Data Factory, Data Science, Real-Time Intelligence, Data Warehouse, Lake House, and Databases.
- It integrates separate components into a cohesive stack.
- It centralizes data storage with OneLake and embeds AI capabilities, eliminating the need for manual integration.
- With Fabric, you can efficiently transform **raw data** into **actionable insights**

### **Microsoft Fabric Architecture**
- Unification with SaaS foundation
- Microsoft Fabric is built on a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform.
- It unifies new and existing components from Power BI, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, and more into a single environment.
