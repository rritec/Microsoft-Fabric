# 🧹 Steps to Create a Delete Activity in Microsoft Fabric Data Pipeline

## 🧭 Objective  
We will **delete a file** named `emp.json` located in the `rawdata` folder of a Lakehouse using a **Delete activity** in a Fabric Data Pipeline.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

- A **Lakehouse** with a file (`emp.json`) stored in a folder named `rawdata`.
- A **Data Pipeline** workspace in Microsoft Fabric.
- A **linked service** connection to the Lakehouse (can be created during the activity setup).

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 🔧 Step 1: Create a New Pipeline
1. Go to your Microsoft Fabric workspace.
2. Click on **New Item** from the left pane.
3. Click **Data pipeline**.
4. Name your pipeline (e.g., `DeleteFilePipeline`).

---

### 🧩 Step 2: Add a Delete Activity
1. From the **Activities** pane, drag and drop the **Delete** activity onto the canvas.
2. Rename it to something meaningful (e.g., `Delete emp.json`).

---

### 📁 Step 3: Configure Source File to Delete
1. Select the **Delete** activity.
2. In the **Settings** tab:
   - Choose or create a **Lakehouse linked service** (select your Lakehouse).
   - Under **Folder path**, enter `rawdata`.
   - Under **File name**, enter `emp.json`.
   - Check **Recursive** if you want to delete everything inside a folder (not needed for a single file).
3. Set **File format type** as **Binary**.

### 🔁 Step 4: Optional Settings
- You can optionally configure:
  - **Timeout**
  - **Retry attempts**
  - **Secure input/output**
  - Logging (can leave off for now)

---

### ▶️ Step 5: Test & Run the Pipeline
1. Click **Validate** (top-right) to ensure there are no errors.
2. Click **Publish**.
3. Click **Trigger now** to run the pipeline.
4. Check the **Monitor** tab to see the run status.
