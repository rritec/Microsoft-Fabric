# Changelog

User-facing changes for the public Microsoft Fabric Skills release.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **`powerbi-report-planning`** — guided requirements-to-implementation workflow for new Power BI reports and dashboards built from semantic models, datasets, or PBIP projects. Use to plan then implement a report end-to-end: define audience, scope, page plan, design direction, dependencies, and delivery target, then produce a locked report spec with explicit approval before any PBIR authoring begins. For direct authoring without the planning gate, invoke `powerbi-report-authoring` directly.
- **`powerbi-report-design`** — visual design guidance for Power BI reports before any PBIR files are written. Use to choose tone, signature, page archetypes, chart types, layout, color, typography, theme direction, and accessibility approach; to redesign/restyle an existing report or apply a brand; or to critique chart and layout choices. Produces a design contract that downstream authoring consumes. Ships with 19 references covering accessibility, anti-patterns, page archetypes (analytical canvas, comparative benchmark, executive summary, narrative story, operational monitor), brownfield migration, chart selection, design brief, interactivity, pre-flight checklist, signatures, tone catalog, typography, and a visual cookbook.
- **`powerbi-report-authoring`** — create and modify Power BI report files in PBIR/PBIP format using the `powerbi-report-author` and `powerbi-desktop` CLIs. Implements an approved report spec or design brief; adds or edits pages, visuals, filters, slicers, bookmarks, themes, and formatting; validates PBIR and verifies rendering in Power BI Desktop. Ships with 23 references covering authoring, cartesian charts, color strategy, conditional formatting, expressions, filter pane, filters, formatting (overview + details), image, page formatting, Power BI Desktop, the `powerbi-report-author` CLI, re-theming, screenshot review, shape, slicers, table, textbox, theming, and version control. For open-ended visual design choices, invoke `powerbi-report-design` first.
- **`powerbi-report-management`** — manage Power BI report workspace items in Microsoft Fabric via `az rest` CLI against the Fabric REST API. Create reports from PBIR definitions, get or download report definitions, update report definitions or properties, list workspace reports, and delete reports. For report layout authoring (pages, visuals, filters, formatting), use `powerbi-report-authoring` instead.
- **`powerbi-authoring` plugin bundle expanded** — the dedicated `powerbi-authoring` plugin now ships the four new `powerbi-report-*` skills alongside `semantic-model-authoring` and `check-updates`, with the `powerbi-modeling-mcp` server pre-configured. Reinstall via `/plugin install powerbi-authoring@fabric-collection` to pick up the new report skills.

### Changed

- **`semantic-model-authoring` DAX performance references refined** — added Microsoft Learn further-reading links for DAX engine tracing, horizontal fusion, and Direct Lake query performance in `dax-perf-decision-guide.md` and `dax-perf-patterns.md`; renamed scenario-specific DAX examples to use generic names; rewrote DAX examples to be self-contained so they're easier to read on their own.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **`semantic-model-authoring`** — develop and manage Power BI semantic models across Power BI Desktop, PBIP projects, and the Fabric Service. Covers creating models (Import, DirectQuery, Direct Lake), editing measures/tables/columns/relationships, deploying to Fabric workspaces, refreshing, configuring data sources and permissions, and DAX performance optimization. Ships with 11 reference guides (connection binding, DAX guidelines, DAX performance decision guide, DAX performance patterns, Direct Lake guidelines, modeling guidelines, naming conventions, PBIP, semantic-model AI readiness, semantic-model REST API, TMDL guidelines). **Replaces `powerbi-authoring-cli`.**
- **`semantic-model-consumption`** — execute raw DAX queries and inspect metadata of Microsoft Fabric Power BI semantic models via the MCP server `ExecuteQuery` tool. Use when you already know the DAX (EVALUATE statements) or need to inspect tables, columns, measures, relationships, and hierarchies via INFO functions. **Replaces `powerbi-consumption-cli`.**
- **`fabriciq`** — answer business questions by querying Power BI reports and dashboards through the FabricIQ MCP endpoint. Orchestrates artifact discovery, schema inspection, entity-value resolution, DAX generation, and query execution; returns plain-language answers. Use for natural-language questions about Power BI report/dashboard content (use `semantic-model-consumption` for raw DAX).
- **`FabricIQ` agent** — answers questions about Power BI artifacts (reports and semantic models) by discovering artifacts, inspecting metadata and schemas, resolving entity values, generating DAX, and executing queries against the Fabric MCP endpoint. Delegates to `fabriciq`.
- **Dedicated `powerbi-authoring` plugin bundle** — ships `semantic-model-authoring` and `check-updates` with the `powerbi-modeling-mcp` server (`@microsoft/powerbi-modeling-mcp`) pre-configured for fine-grained semantic-model modeling operations. Install via `/plugin install powerbi-authoring@fabric-collection`.
- **`dataflows-authoring-cli` reference docs (3 new)** — `output-destinations.md` (Lakehouse/Warehouse/SQL DB output destination patterns including staging behavior, schema mapping, and refresh semantics), `connection-management.md` (creating, binding, and rotating connection IDs for Dataflows Gen2), and `mashup-preview.md` (inspecting and validating Power Query M before publishing).
- **`spark-operations-cli` automated diagnostic workflow** — new `references/automated-diagnostic-workflow.md` for end-to-end Spark/Livy diagnostics: job triage → executor/driver log mining → Spark Advisor findings → mitigation recommendations.
- **`synapse-migration` deep resources (12 new)** — capacity sizing, connector refactoring, external Hive Metastore migration, feature parity matrix, lake database migration, library compatibility, migration gotchas, migration orchestrator, migration report, security and governance, Spark item migration, Spark pool migration, and validation/testing.
- **`EVENTHOUSE-CONSUMPTION-CORE` common reference** — shared Eventhouse/KQL consumption patterns surfaced via the `fabric-authoring` plugin bundle.

### Changed

- **`powerbi-authoring-cli` renamed to `semantic-model-authoring`** — aligns the skill name with the underlying Microsoft Fabric / Power BI artifact (a *semantic model*) rather than the surface tool. Same coverage of model authoring plus an expanded reference library. Re-invoke as `semantic-model-authoring` going forward.
- **`powerbi-consumption-cli` renamed to `semantic-model-consumption`** — same rationale; same DAX query / metadata surface. Re-invoke as `semantic-model-consumption` going forward.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`activator-authoring-cli`** — create alerts, notifications, and automated actions on Fabric data and events via Fabric REST API and `az rest` CLI. Covers Activator/Reflex item creation, trigger configuration, action wiring (Teams messages, emails, Fabric item runs), and connections to Eventhouse, Eventstream, Real-Time Hub, and Digital Twin Builder.
- **`activator-consumption-cli`** — read-only inspection of existing Activator alerts, notifications, and automated actions via `az rest`. List alerts in a workspace, inspect alert configuration, decode `ReflexEntities.json` definitions.

### Changed

- **`spark-diagnostics-cli` renamed to `spark-operations-cli`** — aligned with the three-category naming convention (`-authoring-`, `-consumption-`, `-operations-`). Same skill, same diagnostic surface (failed Spark jobs, unhealthy Livy sessions, OOM/shuffle/skew, driver/executor logs, Spark Advisor findings) — only the name has changed. Re-invoke as `spark-operations-cli` going forward.

### Fixed

- **`/plugin update` now works again for users who installed under the legacy `skills-for-fabric@fabric-collection` id.** When the bundle was renamed in 0.3.0 (`skills-for-fabric` → `fabric-skills`), the old plugin id was dropped from `marketplace.json`, which silently broke `/plugin update skills-for-fabric@fabric-collection` for everyone still on the legacy id (`Plugin "skills-for-fabric" not found in marketplace`). The legacy id is restored as a deprecated alias of `fabric-skills@fabric-collection` — running `/plugin update` under either name now pulls the canonical `fabric-skills` payload. To migrate your installed entry to the canonical id (optional, recommended cleanup): `/plugin uninstall skills-for-fabric@fabric-collection` then `/plugin install fabric-skills@fabric-collection`.
- **`check-updates` skill works inside Copilot CLI plugin installs.** The skill assumed a `package.json` and a `.git/` directory at the install root, but the Copilot CLI plugin install layout (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/fabric-collection/fabric-skills/`) has neither — only `.github/plugin/plugin.json`. Step 1 (read local version), Step 2 (parse repository URL), and Method A (`git fetch origin main`) now read the manifest path that matches the actual install layout. The "Update Available" banner no longer references the `install.ps1` / `install.sh` scripts that were removed from the public release in 0.3.0.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **Plugin bundles for focused installation**
  - `fabric-skills` - complete bundle for Fabric authoring, consumption, operations, migration, and end-to-end architecture workflows.
  - `fabric-authoring` - developer-oriented skills for REST APIs, CLI automation, notebooks, T-SQL, KQL, Eventstreams, Dataflows Gen2, semantic models, and medallion architecture.
  - `fabric-consumption` - read-only and interactive exploration skills for SQL, Spark/Lakehouse, Power BI semantic models, Eventhouse/KQL, Eventstreams, Dataflows Gen2, and catalog search.
  - `fabric-operations` - diagnostics-focused bundle for warehouse performance investigation.
- **Dataflows Gen2 skills**
  - `dataflows-authoring-cli` for creating, updating, and managing Dataflows Gen2 definitions and Power Query M mashups.
  - `dataflows-consumption-cli` for inspecting, monitoring, and exploring Dataflows Gen2 artifacts.
  - `dataflows-save-as-authoring-cli` for Dataflows Gen1 to Gen2 save-as upgrade workflows, readiness assessment, risk checks, and validation.

### Changed

- **Plugin installation is now bundle-scoped.** Installing `fabric-authoring`, `fabric-consumption`, or `fabric-operations` installs only the skills and resources for that bundle instead of copying the entire repository.
- **Plugin packages are self-contained.** Public plugin folders include the materialized skills, agents, common references, and MCP configuration needed for GitHub-based plugin installation.
- **MCP configuration is scoped per bundle.** `fabric-consumption` and `fabric-skills` include the Power BI query MCP server configuration; authoring and operations bundles do not include unused MCP configuration.
- **`sqldw-monitoring-cli` was renamed to `sqldw-operations-cli`.** The new name aligns with the authoring, consumption, and operations skill categories.
- **Catalog search is now part of item discovery guidance.** Skills can use the Fabric Catalog Search API alongside list-and-filter workflows.
- **Version updated to `0.3.0`.**
